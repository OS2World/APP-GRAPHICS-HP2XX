generic.mak    Generic Makefile, primarily for UNIX-like systems

vax.mms        Dummy to remind that the VAX/VMS MMS file is still missing



For installation,

  o  select the makefile template most closely resembling
     your system's needs. On Unix systems, use "generic.mak".

  o  copy it to ../sources/makefile

  o  cd ../sources

  o  manually adapt (edit) makefile. Sorry - installation procedure is only
     beginning to evolve here due to lack of test facilities.

     The special makefiles should hardly need any modification. Edit them
     only if they don't work right away.

     For the generic makefile, there are three configuration steps:

       1) Site-specific changes:

          -- Change the (prefix) definition to where you want to install hp2xx.
          -- Change the compiler (CC) and the compiler switches (CFLAGS).
             The defaults use gcc, of course.
          -- If needed, add library paths and include paths (LDFLAGS, CPPFLAGS).

       2) System-specific changes:

          -- Main configuration step:

             Un-comment the definitions for your target system
             and comment-out the default definitions.

             If your system is not listed, try the defaults first, and modify
             them if needed. Study the other systems' settings to get an idea
             of what modification may be necessary.

       3) Optional additions:

          Optionally add support for modes PIC and PAC by un-commenting
          the appropriate lines.


  o  Run "make all" from ../sources. This should result in a binary file.

  o  Optionally run a few tests using the HP-GL files in ../hp-tests

  o  INSTALLATION:

     Either put this file somewhere on the search path,
     etc. in /usr/local/bin, or run "make install-bin" (if provided).

     Optionally install the documentation (see ../doc/README). If provided
     (generic makefile), use

          -- "make install-man"  to install the manual page,
          -- "make install-info" to install the info file (recommended)

     NOTE:
          -- "make install" installs both the binary and all docs.

  o  Optionally run "make clean" (not always provided).
